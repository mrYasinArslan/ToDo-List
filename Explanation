This program uses an ArrayList to store the to-do list items and a Scanner to read user input. The run() method displays a menu of options and uses a switch statement to execute the appropriate method based on the user's choice. The addItem(), removeItem(), and displayList() methods allow users to add, remove, and display items from the to-do list, respectively. Finally, the main() method creates a new instance of the TodoList class and runs the program.
